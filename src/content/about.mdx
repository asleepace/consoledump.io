**ConsoleDump** is a free, instant remote debugging console that streams your application logs and terminal output to a shareable web interface. No sign up, no installation, no configuration—just three simple steps to start debugging anywhere, anytime.

Perfect for debugging mobile apps, remote servers, embedded devices, or sharing logs with your team. Each session gets a unique URL that updates in real-time as your application sends data.

## Quick Start

Get started with ConsoleDump in three easy steps:

### 1. Start a New Session

Visit [consoledump.io](/) and click "New Session" to instantly create a unique debugging console. You'll receive a session ID like `42a66873` and a dedicated URL where all your logs will appear.

### 2. Copy & Paste the Code Snippet

Choose your preferred method to send logs. The simplest way is with a single curl command:

```bash
curl -d "hello world" https://consoledump.io/42a66873
```

Or integrate directly into your JavaScript/TypeScript code with our ready-to-use snippet (see [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) below).

### 3. View Logs in Real-Time

Open your session URL `https://consoledump.io/42a66873` in any browser. Your logs appear instantly as your application sends them—no page refresh needed. Share the URL with teammates to collaborate on debugging.

## Basic Usage

The most common way to send logs is using a simple JavaScript function with the Fetch API. This works in browsers, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and React Native.

### Quick Integration

Copy and paste this snippet into your code, replacing `42a66873` with your session ID:

```js
// Create a logging function
const dump = (...args) =>
  fetch('https://consoledump.io/42a66873', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(args),
  })

// Start logging anything!
dump('Hello, world!')
dump({ data: 123, name: 'Bob' })
dump([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
dump('User logged in', { userId: 42, timestamp: Date.now() })
```

### Replace Console Methods

For existing applications, redirect your console output to ConsoleDump without changing your code:

```js
// Override console.log
console.log = (...args) => dump('log:', ...args)

// Override all console methods with level tags
console.warn = (...args) => dump('warn:', ...args)
console.error = (...args) => dump('error:', ...args)
console.info = (...args) => dump('info:', ...args)
console.debug = (...args) => dump('debug:', ...args)
```

Now all your existing `console.log()`, `console.error()`, etc. calls will automatically stream to your ConsoleDump session.

## JavaScript/TypeScript Integration

For TypeScript projects or applications that need more control, use this advanced console proxy that keeps local console output while streaming to ConsoleDump.

### Advanced Proxy Setup

This implementation preserves your local console output while simultaneously sending logs to your remote session:

```typescript
// TypeScript: Extend Console interface
declare global {
  interface Console {
    sessionId: string
  }
}

// Set your session ID
Object.defineProperty(console, 'sessionId', {
  value: '42a66873',
  writable: true,
})

// Proxy all console methods
console = new Proxy(console, {
  get(target, prop) {
    const method = target[prop as keyof Console]

    if (typeof method !== 'function') {
      return method
    }

    const override = async (...args: any[]) => {
      fetch(`https://consoledump.io/${target.sessionId}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(args),
        headers: {
          'x-dump-encoding': 'json/args',
          'x-dump-version': '1.0',
        },
      })
    }

    return (...args: any[]) => {
      override(...args).catch(() => {})
      method.apply(target, args)
    }
  },
})
```

### Usage

After setting up the proxy, use console methods normally. Logs appear both in your local console and your ConsoleDump session:

```typescript
console.sessionId = '42a66873'
console.log('Hello, world!') // Appears locally AND online
console.error('Something went wrong')
console.info({ user: 'colin', status: 'active' })
```

This approach is ideal for production debugging where you want to maintain local logs while also streaming to a remote session.

## Command Line Tool

Stream terminal output, server logs, or any command-line program directly to ConsoleDump. Perfect for debugging remote servers, CI/CD pipelines, or sharing terminal sessions with your team.

### Installation

Install the ConsoleDump CLI with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://consoledump.io/install | bash
```

The script installs the `consoledump` command to your system, making it available in any terminal session.

### Usage Examples

Pipe any command output to your ConsoleDump session:

```bash
# Send a simple message
echo "test message" | consoledump 42a66873

# Stream development server output
npm run dev | consoledump 42a66873

# Monitor log files in real-time
tail -f /var/log/app.log | consoledump 42a66873

# Stream Docker container logs
docker logs -f my-container | consoledump 42a66873

# Debug shell scripts
bash deploy.sh 2>&1 | consoledump 42a66873
```

Open your session URL in a browser to watch the terminal output stream in real-time. Perfect for debugging remote deployments, monitoring background jobs, or sharing command-line sessions without screen sharing.

## API Reference

ConsoleDump provides a simple REST API for programmatic access. Use these endpoints to integrate ConsoleDump into custom tools, scripts, or applications.

### Create a Session

Generate a new session ID programmatically:

```http
HEAD https://consoledump.io/api
```

**Response:** The server returns a `x-stream-id` header containing your new session ID.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -I https://consoledump.io/api
# Look for: x-stream-id: 42a66873
```

### Send Data

Post log messages to your session:

```http
POST https://consoledump.io/api/{sessionId}
Content-Type: text/plain

Your log message here
```

**Parameters:**

- `{sessionId}`: Your unique session ID
- Request body: Any text or JSON data to log

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://consoledump.io/api/42a66873 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"level":"info","message":"Server started","port":3000}'
```

### Stream Logs (Server-Sent Events)

Connect to your session's event stream to receive logs in real-time:

```http
GET https://consoledump.io/api/{sessionId}
Accept: text/event-stream
```

**Returns:** A Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream that pushes new log entries as they arrive.

**Example:**

```javascript
const events = new EventSource('https://consoledump.io/api/42a66873')
events.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log('New log:', event.data)
}
```
